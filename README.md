## 🤔 The Problem

Your conversations with AI constantly shift direction. The topic has moved on, but previous discussions and tool outputs are still sitting in the context. Sure, `/compact` can compress things, but it's too blunt — you can't choose what stays and what goes.

**The real problem isn't that the context is "too long". It's that you have zero control over it.**

This happens all the time in real usage:

- 🔄 **Topic switching** — You just finished debugging a bug with AI, then started a high-quality project discussion. But the context is already dominated by the bug fix. Continuing might trigger aggressive compression and attention degradation. You want to stay in flow, but you can't precisely compress just the earlier content.
- 📦 **Irrelevant content buildup** — After 30 turns, tool outputs from much earlier are completely irrelevant now. They're still hogging the context and slowing the model down, and you don't even know exactly where they are.
- 🔍 **Context diagnostics** — The context fills up surprisingly fast and you want to know why. Traditional tools only tell you "how much window is left" — they can't help you pinpoint which nodes are eating space or fix them.

> **What if you could see, edit, and version-control your AI's context like source code?**

That's what hashcode does.

## 💡 The Idea

If Cursor can use AI to edit your **code**, why can't we use AI to edit AI's **context**?

```
Cursor:    AI  →  edits  →  Code
                                         
Us:        AI  →  edits  →  AI's Context  🪆
```

**hashcode** is the first desktop client that:

1. **Visualizes** the entire context your main model actually consumes — as a structured **Context Map**, not a chat log.
2. **Deploys a second AI model** to precisely edit your context — you decide what to keep, what to delete, what to compress, instead of handing it off to a blunt compact command.
3. **Version-controls** every edit, so you can roll back to any previous context state.

One AI doing the thinking. Another AI grooming what the first one sees — under your control. 🪆

## 🌟 Core Features

### 📍 Context Map — See Everything Your Model Sees

![context-map](docs/images_en/screenshot-context-map.png)


The right sidebar turns the raw transcript into a structured, scrollable map:

- **Numbered nodes** — `#1 #2 #3 ...` — each user/assistant turn is one node
- **Token weight colors** — 🟢 normal / 🟡 heavy / 🔴 very heavy — instantly spot bloat
- **Minimap** — bird's-eye overview with a draggable viewport rectangle, like VS Code's minimap
- **Expand on click** — collapsed by default, expand any node to see full markdown or tool call details
- **Multi-select** — `Ctrl+Click` or drag the gutter to select nodes for the AI editor

### 🪆 Context Workbench — AI Editing AI's Context

![workbench-suggest](docs/images_en/screenshot-workbench-2.png)

![workbench-manual](docs/images_en/screenshot-workbench-1.png)

The right panel is the command center for the second AI model, with four tabs:

| Tab | What It Does |
|-----|-------------|
| **💡 Suggest** | Auto-analyzes your context: which nodes are bloated, which tool outputs are redundant |
| **✏️ Manual** | Chat with the context model — "compress nodes #4-7" or "delete the weather tool output" |
| **⏪ Restore** | Browse every context revision, click to restore any previous version |
| **⚙️ Settings** | Configure the context model independently (different model, different provider) |

### 🔧 Precision Editing Tools

The context model has surgical tools to modify individual items inside the context:

| Tool | What It Does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `get_node_details` | Inspect a node's full protocol-layer items | "Show me what's inside node #4" |
| `delete_item` | Remove a specific item from a node | "Delete the shell output from node #6" |
| `replace_item` | Rewrite an item with new content | "Replace the verbose tool output with a summary" |
| `compress_item` | AI-compress an item, preserving its type | "Compress the function_call_output in node #3" |
| `compress_nodes` | Merge multiple nodes into one summary node | "Summarize nodes #2-5 into a single node" |
| `delete_nodes` | Remove entire nodes from context | "Drop nodes #1-3, they're no longer relevant" |

### ⏪ Version Control for Context

Every edit round creates a **revision** — a full snapshot of your context state:

```
Revision #1  ← "Compressed weather tool outputs"        [Restore]
Revision #2  ← "Deleted redundant shell commands"       [Restore] ← Active
Revision #3  ← "Merged nodes #2-5 into summary"         [Restore]
```

- **Linear rollback** — click any revision to restore
- **Undo restore** — changed your mind? One-click undo (until your next action)
- **Full snapshots** — no patches, no merge conflicts. Every revision is a complete copy

### 🔌 Multi-Provider Support

Connect to any LLM provider — for both your main model and your context editor model:

| Provider | Protocol | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **OpenAI** | Responses API | ✅ Built-in |
| **Claude** | Messages API | ✅ Built-in |
| **Gemini** | GenerateContent API | ✅ Built-in |
| **Custom** | Chat Completions | ✅ Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

Mix and match: use GPT for chatting, Claude for context editing. Each provider has independent API key and base URL configuration.

### 🎨 Desktop Client

- **Native window**: Electron desktop app, Windows supported (macOS / Linux planned)
- **Three-panel layout**: sidebar → chat → context map + workbench
- **Dark theme**: deep blacks, no eye strain, designed for long sessions
- **Streaming responses**: both main chat and context model stream in real-time
- **File attachments**: drag & drop images and files into the chat
- **Markdown rendering**: full GFM, syntax highlighting, Mermaid diagrams
- **Project workspaces**: organize conversations by project, with file tree browsing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The "Two-Model" Architecture

1. **Main Model** — the AI you chat with. It reads/writes files, runs commands, answers questions.
2. **Context Model** — a separate AI that only sees the main model's context. It can analyze, compress, and restructure it.

They never run in parallel on the same session. When the context model is editing, the main chat is paused (and vice versa). This prevents conflicting writes.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Desktop Shell** | Electron 37 | Cross-platform native window, Python backend auto-managed |
| **Frontend** | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite | Fast dev, type safety, modern DX |
| **Backend** | Python (child process) | Zero-framework, minimal deps, lifecycle managed by Electron |
| **LLM Runtime** | Custom `agent_runtime` | Provider-agnostic adapter layer (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini) |
| **Storage** | Local SQLite + JSON settings (user data dir) | Single-file local database, data stays local |
| **Streaming** | Server-Sent Events (SSE) | Real-time token streaming |

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Claude Code / Codex's /compact?</strong></summary>

compact is a black box — you don't know what it compressed, what it kept, and you can't roll it back. It solves "context too long", but it doesn't solve "there's stuff in my context I don't want".

hashcode is about **context freedom**: you can see how many tokens each node takes, precisely delete a specific tool output, compress a few old conversation turns, or clean up earlier content in one sentence when switching topics — and roll back anytime. Not brute-force compression. Precise control.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the context model actually modify what the main model sees?</strong></summary>

Yes. When the context model compresses or deletes items, those changes are committed to the canonical transcript. The next time the main model responds, it sees the edited version. This is not a UI trick — it's actual context engineering.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this reduce cache hit rates?</strong></summary>

Theoretically yes, but when an agent is making frequent API calls, each context operation recalculates the cache at most once. This is far cheaper than carrying around useless context indefinitely.

</details>
